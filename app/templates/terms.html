        <b>4. Booking Treatments</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            a. Treatments Booked Through the Service. Sensual Massage Members understand that Providers are highly trained, 
            certified and licensed (where applicable under relevant state law) and specialize in massage therapy, 
            personal training, assisted stretch, yoga, mindfulness, and other health and wellness techniques. 
            Sensual Massage does not tolerate any requests deemed sexual or inappropriate in nature. Users reported for 
            inappropriate behavior will be immediately removed from the Service. Sensual Massage Members agree that Treatments 
            are for therapeutic purposes only and should not be used if the person who will receive the Treatment is 
            on any medication that would be expected to weaken bone structure and/or connective tissue or lead to 
            enhanced bleeding; have edema due to chronic heart failure or kidney failure; have an inflammatory 
            condition in the acute stage; have acute phlebitis and/or deep venous thrombosis; have had an acute 
            trauma or recent surgery; are in the first trimester of pregnancy; or where Treatment is otherwise 
            contraindicated. A Sensual Massage Member who uses the Service to book a Treatment on his or her own behalf 
            should consult a physician if uncertain as to whether a Treatment is appropriate for such Sensual Massage Member, 
            and a Sensual Massage Member who uses the Service to book a Treatment on behalf of a third party should encourage 
            that third party to do the same.   
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            b. Prices. The fees listed on the Service are the standard fees for the listed service, which Sensual Massage may 
            change at any time in its sole discretion by so posting on the Service. In addition, fees for services 
            provided by a Provider may vary depending on a variety of factors such as length, day, time, or location 
            of appointment. The fee you are ultimately charged is the "Fee."
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            c. No Liability. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Sensual Massage will not have any liability 
            whatsoever for any of the services provided by Providers. Providers bear sole liability for 
            all of the services provided, including those services that are booked through the Service. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            d. Exclusive Booking through Sensual Massage. In order to receive pre-negotiated rates with Providers, 
            Sensual Massage Members agree that once a Sensual Massage Member has made an appointment with a Provider through 
            the Sensual Massage Network, all subsequent appointments with the Provider will be made through Sensual Massage, 
            for as long as: (i) the Provider is an active participant in the Sensual Massage Network, and (ii) the 
            Sensual Massage Member continues to keep its account with Sensual Massage active and in good standingHE SERVICE 
            ARE NOT FOR MEDICAL EMERGENCIES. IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE AN EMERGENCY, CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            e. Responsibility for Payment. You will be charged the Fee following your receipt of a 
            Treatment by a Provider. You agree to pay to Sensual Massage all Fees, whether or not you dispute 
            the amount of the charge or the quality or nature of the services provided. 
            You acknowledge that Treatments obtained through the Service in all likelihood will 
            not be covered services under your benefit plan, the Medicare program, a state Medicaid 
            program, or any health insurance plan whether government-sponsored or private. 
            You acknowledge and agree that Sensual Massage will not file any claims with your insurance 
            benefit plan, the Medicare program, a state Medicaid program, or any other third 
            party medical benefits program, and that the services you receive from or through 
            Sensual Massage may not be eligible for reimbursement under such plans. You acknowledge, 
            understand and agree that when using the Service, you may be responsible for 
            standard phone, data and messaging charges from your wireless carrier. Under no 
            circumstances will Sensual Massage be responsible for any wireless email, data, phone, or text 
            messaging charges incurred by you or by a person that has access to your wireless 
            device, telephone number, or email address.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            f. Cancellations. If you cancel before your scheduled Treatment, then Sensual Massage may charge you a 
            cancellation fee, which will be set forth in the Cancellation Policy.   
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            g. Dispute Resolution. Although Sensual Massage retains the right to mediate any dispute between you and 
            a Provider, all disputes between you and such Provider must ultimately be resolved between 
            you and the Provider directly. All sales booked through the Service are final and Sensual Massage 
            provides no refunds, except as determined in Sensual Massageâ€™s sole discretion. For avoidance of doubt, 
            Sensual Massage will not refund you for any reason if you receive a Treatment, except as determined in 
            its sole discretion. If you engage in conduct deemed inappropriate or unsafe by a Provider, 
            as determined in the Providerâ€™s sole discretion, including, but not limited to, making 
            inappropriate requests, engaging in inappropriate touching, or the Provider perceives a 
            threat to his/her safety or well-being, and such conduct results in a Provider ending the 
            Treatment prior to the end of the allotted time, Sensual Massage will not refund you.
